## Abstract 

Mismodeling the uncertain, diffuse emission of Galactic origin can seriously bias the characterization of astrophysical gamma-ray data, particularly in the region of the Inner Milky Way where such emission can make up over 80% of the photon counts observed at ~GeV energies. We introduce a novel class of methods that use Gaussian processes and variational inference to build flexible background and signal models for gamma-ray analyses with the goal of enabling a more robust interpretation of the make-up of the gamma-ray sky, particularly focusing on characterizing potential signals of dark matter in the Galactic Center with data from the Fermi telescope.

## Code

### Dependencies

The code dependencies are given in [environments.yml](environment.yml).

### Running experiments 

The `inference.constructor.ModelConstructor` class creates simulated _Fermi_ data and instantiates a `GPyTorch`/`Pyro` model for GP inference. The `inference.trainer.PyroSVITrainer` class is used for training.

The following instantiates these classes and reproduces the experiments used for the paper:
```
python train.py --guide_name MVN --num_inducing 200 --poiss_only
python train.py --guide_name IAF --num_inducing 200 --poiss_only
python train.py --guide_name ConditionalIAF --num_inducing 200 --poiss_only
```
where the `--guide_name` option specifies different variational distributions that can be used for the template parameters:
- `MVN`: Multivariate normal guide, models template parameters as correlated Gaussians.
- `IAF`: Uses an [inverse autoregressive flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04934) to model template parameters.
- `ConditionalIAF`: Uses an [inverse autoregressive flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04934) conditioned on summary statistics of the Gaussian process draws (see paper for more information).

These variational guides are defined in [models/template_param.py](models/template_param.py).

[notebooks/fermi-gp-poiss.ipynb](notebooks/fermi-gp-poiss.ipynb) can be used to analyze the runs and also run inference interactively in a notebook. See [inference/constructor.py](inference/constructor.py) for a list of configurable parameters.
### Non-Poissonian regression 

Removing the `--poiss_only` option runs a [non-Poissonian template fit](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03173). **This is untested.** A stand-alone, differentiable version of the non-Poissonian likelihood can be found in [models/likelihoods.py](models/likelihoods.py).
